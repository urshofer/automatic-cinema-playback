# Automatic Cinema Playback Environment

**What this is**

In this repository you can find the Playback Client and Playback Server for the Automatic Cinema Project. For osx, there will be precompiled binaries. For linux you need to build these applications from scratch.

**How to build**

Both server and player are built with openframeworks. To ease the build process, openframeworks and all necessary addons are included. Currently, osx, ios and linux are supported. Refer to the openframeworks.cc documentation to learn how to build an openframeworks appllication.

**How to run**

Both applications in this repository, player and server, are part of the larger scale Automatic Cinema System. For a complete running system, you'll need

- This player and server: ```https://github.com/urshofer/automatic-cinema-playback```
- The controller: ```https://github.com/urshofer/automatic-cinema-controller```
- The content server: ```https://github.com/urshofer/automatic-cinema-server```

Please refer to the readme's of the other repositories.

Once, you have a server and a controller running and you've uploaded some material, you can start the playback system.
